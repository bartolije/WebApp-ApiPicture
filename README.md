# Azure API test - C#

This project was done for a school lesson, on purpose to deal and manage with Microsoft API (cognitive service), but also manage azure web devices.

Actually, this project is able to do the following

  - Get image and display them from an user text input
  - Add a device to the azure cloud
  - Get all device

You can also:
  - Easily use another Microsoft cognitive service API
  - Use a device, manage it, delete it
  - Send data to and from device


### Installation

Actually using Visual Studio 2015 [Download](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/).

Download and build the [latest version](https://github.com/bartolije/WebApp-ApiPicture).

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.
Please note that you may need to install the Azure SDK.

### TODO List

Because anyone need a todo list.
It would be awesome to add a proper and sexy form.
Also, add a proper internal and generic interface, to manage and deal with all API methods.

Finally, I guess we can work with some settings file, to avoid clear or trash string in code.


### Notes

You will need to provide the correct API Key, and also device connection string.
